# Feature Specification: Rekordbox Streaming Tag Exporter

**Feature Branch**: `001-when-the-command`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "When the command is run it should: - Show a list of tags fetched from the Rekordbox database that the user can check/uncheck - When done and continuing, all songs in the library that are from streaming services (so not local files) and contains at least one tag should be found - A list of all the matched songs, artist and title, should be exported to a .csv"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DJ using Rekordbox, I want to export streaming tracks with specific tags to a CSV file so that I can analyze my music library, create playlists in external tools, or share track information with collaborators. The user launches the command-line tool, selects relevant tags from their Rekordbox database through an interactive checklist, and receives a CSV file containing artist and title information for all streaming tracks that match the selected tags.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Rekordbox database with streaming tracks that have tags, **When** the user runs the command, **Then** a list of all available tags is displayed with checkboxes for selection
2. **Given** the user has selected one or more tags from the list, **When** the user confirms their selection, **Then** the system finds all streaming tracks (non-local files) that contain at least one of the selected tags
3. **Given** streaming tracks with matching tags have been found, **When** the export process completes, **Then** a CSV file is created containing the artist and title of each matching track
4. **Given** the user selects no tags, **When** they attempt to continue, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should this export all streaming tracks, show an error, or allow empty export?]
5. **Given** the user has streaming tracks but none have the selected tags, **When** the export runs, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should this create an empty CSV, show a warning, or report no matches?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Rekordbox database is not found or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle tracks with missing artist or title information?
- What occurs when duplicate tracks exist with the same artist/title combination?
- How are special characters in artist/title names handled in CSV export?
- What happens if the selected output directory is not writable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read and access the Rekordbox database to retrieve tag and track information
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all available tags from the database in an interactive checklist format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select and deselect multiple tags from the displayed list
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter tracks to include only streaming service tracks (excluding local files)
- **FR-005**: System MUST find all tracks that contain at least one of the user-selected tags
- **FR-006**: System MUST export matching tracks to a CSV file containing artist and title columns
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle tracks with missing artist or title data gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should missing data be represented in CSV?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user feedback during the tag selection and export process
- **FR-009**: CSV export MUST handle Unicode characters properly for international artist/track names
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that at least one tag is selected before proceeding with export [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: or allow no-tag selection with specific behavior?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tag**: Represents a Rekordbox tag/label that can be assigned to tracks, contains tag name and potentially color/category information
- **Track**: Represents a music track in the Rekordbox library, contains artist, title, file location, streaming service indicator, and associated tags
- **CSV Export**: Represents the output file containing filtered track information, structured with artist and title columns
- **Streaming Track Filter**: Represents the logic for distinguishing streaming service tracks from local files based on file path or metadata
