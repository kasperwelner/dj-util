# Feature Specification: Rekordbox Streaming Tag Exporter

**Feature Branch**: `001-when-the-command`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "When the command is run it should: - Show a list of tags fetched from the Rekordbox database that the user can check/uncheck - When done and continuing, all songs in the library that are from streaming services (so not local files) and contains at least one tag should be found - A list of all the matched songs, artist and title, should be exported to a .csv"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When a user selects no tags from the checklist, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show an error message and require at least one tag selection
- Q: How should the system distinguish streaming tracks from local files in the Rekordbox database? ‚Üí A: check if FolderPath field is empty
- Q: How should tracks with missing artist or title information be represented in the CSV export? ‚Üí A: Leave the field completely empty (blank cell)
- Q: When no streaming tracks match the selected tags, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Display a warning message and abort without creating a file
- Added requirement: Include track ID (Content.ID from database) as first column in CSV export for future reference

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DJ using Rekordbox, I want to export streaming tracks with specific MyTags to a CSV file so that I can analyze my music library, create playlists in external tools, or share track information with collaborators. The user launches the command-line tool, selects relevant MyTags from their Rekordbox database through an interactive checklist, and receives a CSV file containing track ID, artist, and title information for all streaming tracks that match the selected MyTags.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Rekordbox database with streaming tracks that have MyTags, **When** the user runs the command, **Then** a list of all available MyTags is displayed with checkboxes for selection
2. **Given** the user has selected one or more MyTags from the list, **When** the user confirms their selection, **Then** the system finds all streaming tracks (non-local files) that contain at least one of the selected MyTags
3. **Given** streaming tracks with matching MyTags have been found, **When** the export process completes, **Then** a CSV file is created containing the track ID, artist, and title of each matching track
4. **Given** the user selects no MyTags, **When** they attempt to continue, **Then** the system displays an error message and requires at least one MyTag selection
5. **Given** the user has streaming tracks but none have the selected MyTags, **When** the export runs, **Then** the system displays a warning message and aborts without creating a file

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Rekordbox database is not found or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle tracks with missing artist or title information?
- What occurs when duplicate tracks exist with the same artist/title combination?
- How are special characters (quotes, commas, newlines) in artist/title names escaped in CSV export?
- What happens if the selected output directory is not writable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read and access the Rekordbox database to retrieve MyTag and track information
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all available MyTags from the database in an interactive checklist format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select and deselect multiple MyTags from the displayed list
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter tracks to include only streaming service tracks by checking for empty FolderPath field (excluding local files)
- **FR-005**: System MUST find all tracks that contain at least one of the user-selected MyTags
- **FR-006**: System MUST export matching tracks to a CSV file containing track ID, artist, and title columns
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle tracks with missing artist or title data gracefully by leaving corresponding CSV fields completely empty
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user feedback during the MyTag selection and export process
- **FR-009**: CSV export MUST handle Unicode characters properly for international artist/track names (including Japanese, Cyrillic, emoji, and accented characters)
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that at least one MyTag is selected before proceeding with export and display an error message if no MyTags are selected
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a warning message and abort without creating a file when no streaming tracks match the selected MyTags
- **FR-012**: System MUST include all duplicate tracks (same artist/title) in the export, each with their unique track ID to differentiate them
- **FR-013**: System MUST properly escape CSV special characters (commas, quotes, newlines) following RFC 4180 standard

### Optional Requirements
- **OR-001**: System MAY provide a --limit flag to restrict the number of exported tracks for testing purposes
- **OR-002**: System MAY support a --verbose flag to display detailed progress information during processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tag (MyTag)**: Represents a Rekordbox MyTag that can be assigned to tracks, contains tag ID and name (no color information in Rekordbox MyTags)
- **Track**: Represents a music track in the Rekordbox library, contains artist, title, file location, streaming service indicator, and associated MyTags
- **CSV Export**: Represents the output file containing filtered track information, structured with track ID, artist, and title columns
- **Streaming Track Filter**: Represents the logic for distinguishing streaming service tracks from local files by checking for empty FolderPath field in Rekordbox database
